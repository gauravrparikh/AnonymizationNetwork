# Directory server 
'''
1. Client sends a request to the directory server to discover a path to a final destination. 
2. Directory server returns a path to the client.

Some datastructure that returns a path? 

Trust the directory server to know the correct nodes.

relay_nodes = [node1, node2, node3, node4, node5]
public_key_of_nodes = [key1, key2, key3, key4, key5]


return path = [(node1, key1), (node2, key2), (node3, key3)]
